About XYDORA (Employee Perspective):

I work at XYDORA, a dynamic technology agency based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, dedicated to delivering innovative cloud and software solutions that empower businesses worldwide. XYDORA specialises in custom software and app development, creating tailored digital ecosystems that drive growth, efficiency, and user engagement. Our mission is to help businesses innovate, scale, and succeed in the digital era by providing secure, scalable, and user-focused software solutions.

At XYDORA, we deliver a wide range of custom software and app development services tailored to meet diverse business needs. We develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android, as well as cross-platform solutions, ensuring smooth performance and excellent user experience across devices. Our expertise also includes building secure, scalable web applications designed specifically for different industries. In the design phase, we focus on UI/UX to create modern and engaging user interfaces that help drive customer engagement and conversions. For clients looking to quickly validate their ideas, we develop Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that provide rapid prototypes with core features. Beyond initial development, I’m involved in providing ongoing app maintenance, scaling, and support to keep applications updated, optimized, and ready for growth. We also offer app re-engineering services to revitalize existing applications with upgrades that improve performance and functionality.

In addition to development, I support strategic IT consulting efforts where we guide clients in modernizing their technology stack for long-term success. Our dynamic team augmentation service enables clients to flexibly expand their teams with skilled experts from our side, helping them manage workloads or bring in specialised knowledge quickly. We specialise in SAAS development too, creating cloud-based, subscription-driven software with a focus on scalability and accessibility. To enhance efficiency, we implement streamlined DevOps practices that unify development and operations, accelerating release cycles. Lastly, we deploy advanced test automation strategies to ensure quality and speed throughout the development process. Being part of these comprehensive services gives me confidence that we can deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations, supporting their growth and innovation goals every step of the way.

Our pricing depends on the specific needs and complexity of each client’s project. We don’t offer one-size-fits-all packages because every business is different. Instead, we provide customised quotes tailored to your goals and budget. If you want to know about pricing or get an estimate, just reach out to our team—we’ll work closely with you to understand your requirements and offer a clear, fair proposal.

What makes XYDORA stand out is our holistic approach. We don’t just build apps; we create customised digital ecosystems that align perfectly with your business goals. Our end-to-end support covers everything from initial discovery and strategy, through agile development and rigorous quality assurance, to deployment and growth management. This ensures your product not only meets the highest standards but also adapts to changing market demands.

With over 10 years of experience and more than 18 successful projects, our team of 60+ skilled software engineers brings expertise across multiple industries, including healthcare, e-commerce, fintech, education, travel, real estate, media, logistics, SaaS, and food & beverage. This broad sector knowledge helps us deliver solutions tailored to specific business challenges and regulatory environments.

We pride ourselves on working with modern technology frameworks to build future-proof products. XYDORA is trusted by startups and global enterprises alike for our commitment to quality, security, and innovation. Our clients consistently praise our ability to understand their needs, deliver custom solutions, and provide unmatched post-launch support.

Their work with MACDOSOFT transformed pension planning for major Bangladeshi firms by creating an automated SaaS application that replaced outdated manual systems.
